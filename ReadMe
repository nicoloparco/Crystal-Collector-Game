#Features
The Crystal Collector Game is a javascript and jQuery driven game that assigns random values to several crystals. 
Each time a crystal is clicked its value is determined and added to the page. This value then contributes to your current score.
A randomly score to reach is generated each time and the goal of the game is to hit the score exactly without going over.
Each time the score is reached a win will be tallied and each time it goes over a loss will be tallied.
This project is also styled using Bootstrap.
